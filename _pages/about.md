I am a Software Engineer at WSO2 LLC, Sri Lanka/USA. My current research interests lie in Serverless Computing, Edge Computing, Cloud Architecture, Trusted Computing and
Cloud Security.

I completed my Bachelor's in Engineering with First Class Honours in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, and was awarded the IBM Gold Medal for the best academic performance in Computer Science and Engineering.

My final year thesis project was "TruFass - A Trust Verification Framework for FaaS". This research aimed to introduce a novel trust verification framework architecture to calculate and verify the trust of functions on a FaaS platform. Additionally, I have worked on many projects related to web and cloud technologies during my university years.
