I am a recent Computer Science graduate with a strong passion for system security and privacy. **My research interests lie in building secure, trustworthy and privacy-preserving computing systems**. I particularly enjoy the constant evolution of the security domain, where new security solutions are continuously tested and challenged.

I completed my Bachelorâ€™s in Engineering with First Class Honours in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and was honored with the IBM Gold Medal for the best academic performance in the discipline.

For my undergraduate research project, I worked on "TruFass - A Trust Verification Framework for FaaS," which aimed to develop a novel framework for calculating and verifying the trust of functions on Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms. In addition to this, I have contributed to various projects related to computer security, software engineering, mobile computing and cloud technologies during my time at university.

Currently, I am working as a full-time Software Engineer at WSO2 LLC, where I have gained industry experience in topics related to system security, cloud computing, and AI.

According to ChatGPT my life looks like this :)
