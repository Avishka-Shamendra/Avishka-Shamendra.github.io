I am a Software Engineer at WSO2 LLC, Sri Lanka/USA. My current research interests lie in Serverless Computing and Cloud Security. Presently, I am working on introducing a governance feature to the WSO2 API-M product to further enhance API security.

I completed my Bachelor's in Engineering with First Class Honours in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. I was awarded the IBM Gold Medal for the best performance in Computer Science and Engineering as well. 

My final year thesis project was "TruFass - A Trust Verification Framework for FaaS". This research aimed to introduce a novel trust verification framework architecture to calculate and verify the trust of functions on a FaaS platform. Additionally, I have worked on many projects related to web and cloud technologies during my university years.
